# 4\. Graphs {#4-graphs}

Graphs is abstract mathematical objects to model complex problems into simple representation. Graph theory became a major branch of mathematics that has been studied intensively for hundreds of years since Euler introduced this idea to solve “seven bridge of konigsberg” at 1735\. There are four important type of graphs:

1.  Graphs that have simple connections.

2.  Digraphs that the direction of each connection is significant.

3.  Edge-wighted graphs that each connection has an associated weight.

4.  Edge-weighted digraphs that each connection has both direction and a weight.
